Building my Own Arcade

I have been working on some variation of an arcade cabinet that for some reason or another that never came to be... Until now!

I designed the cabinet in Solidworks and the PCBs in Eagle, I have included cultists, detailed drawings, BOMâ€™s for purchased parts, datasheets, and pretty much any other info you would need to make the cabinet.  

I also generated STLs and Gerbers for anyone that doesn't have access to them fancy CAD programs.

Shout out to my friends Rob and Ruffino for helping me out with the Artwork and CNC/wood working!
